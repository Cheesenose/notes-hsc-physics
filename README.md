A repository for new syllabus Physics HSC notes

Goals
-----
- To provide notes that are:
    - understandable to senior students
    - free
    - sorted by syllabus contents
- To allow anyone to add to or improve on the explanations within

What this isn't
---------------
- This is not supposed to be a replacement for a reputable textbook
- There are no guarantees as to the accuracy of the knowledge within this document

Contributing
------------
- Please see the [RST and Sphinx Cheatsheet](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) and the [Git cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- **Please ensure that you have rights to all images you contribute.** This means **no** screenshots of either the Pearson or CIF textbooks. If necessary, this might mean referring to a specific figure in a textbook, or creating your own (straight copies are *still copies*).
- If you have images under a Creative Commons license, please add attribution
- Please have git commits in the following format: `[<area>] <add/remove/update> <dotpoint>`, where:
    - `<area>` is either: `structure`, `project`, or `module-X`
    - `<dotpoint>` is the dotpoint being updated
    - For example, `[module-8] Add qualitative tests for the presence of aqueous ions`
