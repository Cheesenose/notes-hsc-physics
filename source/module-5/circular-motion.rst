Circular Motion
===============

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** Why do objects move in circles?

   * conduct investigations to explain and evaluate, for objects executing uniform circular motion, the relationships that exist between:

     * centripetal force

     * mass 

     * speed

     * radius 

   * analyse the forces acting on an object executing uniform circular motion in a variety of situations, for example:

     * cars moving around horizontal circular bends

     * a mass on a string

     * objects on banked tracks (ACSPH100)  

   * solve problems, model and make quantitative predictions about objects executing uniform circular motion in a variety of situations, using the following relationships:

     * $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

     * $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$

     * $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

     * $\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{t}$

   * investigate the relationship between the total energy and work done on an object executing uniform circular motion

   * investigate the relationship between the rotation of mechanical systems and the applied torque

     * $\tau = r_{\perp}F = rF\sin\theta$
