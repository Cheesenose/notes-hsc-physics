Motion in Gravitational Fields
==============================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How does the force of gravity determine the motion of planets and satellites?

   * apply qualitatively and quantitatively Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to:

     * determine the force of gravity between two objects 

     * investigate the factors that affect the gravitational field strength 

     * predict the gravitational field strength at any point in a gravitational field, including at the surface of a planet (ACSPH094, ACSPH095, ACSPH097)

   * investigate the orbital motion of planets and artificial satellites when applying the relationships between the following quantities:   

     * gravitational force

     * centripetal force

     * centripetal acceleration

     * mass

     * orbital radius

     * orbital velocity

     * orbital period

   * predict quantitatively the orbital properties of planets and satellites in a variety of situations, including near the Earth and geostationary orbits, and relate these to their uses (ACSPH101)  

   * investigate the relationship of Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion to the forces acting on, and the total energy of, planets in circular and non-circular orbits using: (ACSPH101)

     * $v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$

     * $\frac{r^3}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{4\pi^2}$

   * derive quantitatively and apply the concepts of gravitational force and gravitational potential energy in radial gravitational fields to a variety of situations, including but not limited to:  

     * the concept of escape velocity $v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$

     * total potential energy of a planet or satellite in its orbit $U = \frac{-GMm}{r}$

     * total energy of a planet or satellite in its orbit $U + K = \frac{-GMm}{2r}$

     * energy changes that occur when satellites move between orbits (ACSPH096)

     * Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion (ACSPH101)
