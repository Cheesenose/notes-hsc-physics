Projectile Motion
=================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How can models that are used to explain projectile motion be used to analyse and make predictions?

   * analyse the motion of projectiles by resolving the motion into horizontal and vertical components, making the following assumptions:

     * a constant vertical acceleration due to gravity

     * zero air resistance

   * apply the modelling of projectile motion to quantitatively derive the relationships between the following variables:

     * initial velocity

     * launch angle

     * maximum height

     * time of flight

     * final velocity

     * launch height

     * horizontal range of the projectile (ACSPH099)

   * conduct a practical investigation to collect primary data in order to validate the relationships derived above.

   * solve problems, create models and make quantitative predictions by applying the equations of motion relationships for uniformly accelerated and constant rectilinear motion
