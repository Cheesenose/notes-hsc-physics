Advanced Mechanics
==================

    Motion in one dimension at constant velocity or constant acceleration can
    be explained and analysed relatively simply. However, motion is frequently
    more complicated because objects move in two or three dimensions, causing
    the net force to vary in size or direction. Students develop an
    understanding that all forms of complex motion can be understood by
    analysing the forces acting on a system, including the energy
    transformations taking place within and around the system. By applying new
    mathematical techniques, students model and predict the motion of objects
    within systems. They examine two-dimensional motion, including projectile
    motion and uniform circular motion, along with the orbital motion of
    planets and satellites, which are modelled as an approximation to uniform
    circular motion.
