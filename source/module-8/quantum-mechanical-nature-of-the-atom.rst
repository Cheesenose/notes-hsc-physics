Quantum Mechanical Nature of the Atom
=====================================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How is it known that classical physics cannot explain the properties of the atom?

   * assess the limitations of the Rutherford and Bohr atomic models 

   * investigate the line emission spectra to examine the Balmer series in hydrogen (ACSPH138) 

   * relate qualitatively and quantitatively the quantised energy levels of the hydrogen atom and the law of conservation of energy to the line emission spectrum of hydrogen using:

     * $E = hf$

     * $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

     * $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left[\frac{1}{n^2_f} - \frac{1}{n^2_i}\right]$ (ACSPH136)  

   * investigate de Broglie’s matter waves, and the experimental evidence that developed the following formula:

     * $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$ (ACSPH140)  

   * analyse the contribution of Schrödinger to the current model of the atom
