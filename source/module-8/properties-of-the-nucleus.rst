Properties of the Nucleus
=========================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How can the energy of the atomic nucleus be harnessed?

   * analyse the spontaneous decay of unstable nuclei, and the properties of the alpha, beta and gamma radiation emitted (ACSPH028, ACSPH030) 

   * examine the model of half-life in radioactive decay and make quantitative predictions about the activity or amount of a radioactive sample using the following relationships:

     * $N_t = N_0e^{-\lambda t}$

     * $\lambda = \frac{\ln{2}}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}$

   * where $N_t = $ number of particles at time $t$, $N_0 = $ number of particles present at $t = 0$, $\lambda = $ decay constant, $t_{\frac{1}{2}} = $ time for half the radioactive amount to decay (ACSPH029)  

   * model and explain the process of nuclear fission, including the concepts of controlled and uncontrolled chain reactions, and account for the release of energy in the process (ACSPH033, ACSPH034) 

   * analyse relationships that represent conservation of mass-energy in spontaneous and artificial nuclear transmutations, including alpha decay, beta decay, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion (ACSPH032)  

   * account for the release of energy in the process of nuclear fusion (ACSPH035, ACSPH036) 

   * predict quantitatively the energy released in nuclear decays or transmutations, including nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, by applying: (ACSPH031, ACSPH035, ACSPH036)  

     * the law of conservation of energy

     * mass defect

     * binding energy 

     * Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence relationship $E=mc^2$
