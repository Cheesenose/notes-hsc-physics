From the Universe to the Atom
=============================

    Humans have always been fascinated with the finite or infinite state of the
    Universe and whether there ever was a beginning to time. Where does all the
    matter that makes up the Universe come from? Ideas and theories about the
    beginnings of the Universe, based on sound scientific evidence, have come
    and gone. Current theories such as the Big Bang theory and claims of an
    expanding Universe are based on scientific evidence available today through
    investigations that use modern technologies. Evidence gathered on the
    nucleosynthesis reactions in stars allows scientists to understand how
    elements are made in the nuclear furnace of stars. On scales as large as
    the Universe to those as small as an atom, humans look to the sky for
    answers through astronomical observations of stars and galaxies. Beginning
    in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, experimental discoveries
    revolutionised the accepted understanding of the nature of matter on an
    atomic scale. Observations of the properties of matter and light inspired
    the development of better models of matter, which in turn have been
    modified or abandoned in the light of further experimental investigations.
    By studying the development of the atomic models through the work of
    Thomson and Rutherford, who established the nuclear model of the atom – a
    positive nucleus surrounded by electrons – students further their
    understanding of the limitations of theories and models. The work of Bohr,
    de Broglie and, later, Schrödinger demonstrated that the quantum mechanical
    nature of matter was a better way to understand the structure of the atom.
    Experimental investigations of the nucleus have led to an understanding of
    radioactive decay, the ability to extract energy from nuclear fission and
    fusion, and a deeper understanding of the atomic model. Particle
    accelerators have revealed that protons themselves are not fundamental, and
    have continued to provide evidence in support of the Standard Model of
    matter. In studying this module, students can appreciate that the
    fundamental particle model is forever being updated and that our
    understanding of the nature of matter remains incomplete.
