Origins of the Elements
=======================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** What evidence is there for the origins of the elements?

   * investigate the processes that led to the transformation of radiation into matter that followed the ‘Big Bang’  

   * investigate the evidence that led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe by Hubble (ACSPH138)  

   * analyse and apply Einstein’s description of the equivalence of energy and mass and relate this to the nuclear reactions that occur in stars (ACSPH031) 

   * account for the production of emission and absorption spectra and compare these with a continuous black body spectrum (ACSPH137)  

   * investigate the key features of stellar spectra and describe how these are used to classify stars 

   * investigate the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and how it can be used to determine the following about a star:   

     * characteristics and evolutionary stage

     * surface temperature

     * colour

     * luminosity

   * investigate the types of nucleosynthesis reactions involved in Main Sequence and Post-Main Sequence stars, including but not limited to:  

     * proton–proton chain

     * CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle
