Charged Particles, Conductors and Electric and Magnetic Fields
==============================================================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** What happens to stationary and moving charged particles when they interact with an electric or magnetic field?

   * investigate and quantitatively derive and analyse the interaction between charged particles and uniform electric fields, including: (ACSPH083)  

     * electric field between parallel charged plates $E = \frac{V}{d}$

     * acceleration of charged particles by the electric field $\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$, $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$

     * work done on the charge $W=qV$, $W=qEd$, $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$

   * model qualitatively and quantitatively the trajectories of charged particles in electric fields and compare them with the trajectories of projectiles in a gravitational field    

   * analyse the interaction between charged particles and uniform magnetic fields, including: (ACSPH083)

     * acceleration, perpendicular to the field, of charged particles

     * the force on the charge $F=qv_{\perp}B=qvB\sin\theta$

   * compare the interaction of charged particles moving in magnetic fields to: 

     * the interaction of charged particles with electric fields

     * other examples of uniform circular motion (ACSPH108)
