The Motor Effect

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** Under what circumstances is a force produced on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field?

   * investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the interaction between a current-carrying conductor and a uniform magnetic field $F=lI_{\perp}B=lIB\sin\theta$ to establish: (ACSPH080, ACSPH081)   

     * conditions under which the maximum force is produced

     * the relationship between the directions of the force, magnetic field strength and current

     * conditions under which no force is produced on the conductor

   * conduct a quantitative investigation to demonstrate the interaction between two parallel current-carrying wires

   * analyse the interaction between two parallel current-carrying wires $\frac{F}{l} = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I_1I_2}{r}$ and determine the relationship between the International System of Units (SI) definition of an ampere and Newtonâ€™s Third Law of Motion (ACSPH081, ACSPH106)
