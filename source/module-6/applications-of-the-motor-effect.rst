Applications of the Motor Effect
================================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How has knowledge about the Motor Effect been applied to technological advances?

   * investigate the operation of a simple DC motor to analyse:

     * the functions of its components

     * production of a torque $\tau = nIA_{\perp}B =nIAB\sin\theta$

     * effects of back emf (ACSPH108)   

   * analyse the operation of simple DC and AC generators and AC induction motors (ACSPH110) 

   * relate Lenzâ€™s Law to the law of conservation of energy and apply the law of conservation of energy to:

     * DC motors and

     * magnetic braking
