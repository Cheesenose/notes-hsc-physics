Electromagnetism
================

    Discoveries about the interactions that take place between charged
    particles and electric and magnetic fields not only produced significant
    advances in physics, but also led to significant technological
    developments. These developments include the generation and distribution of
    electricity, and the invention of numerous devices that convert electrical
    energy into other forms of energy. Understanding the similarities and
    differences in the interactions of single charges in electric and magnetic
    fields provides students with a conceptual foundation for this module.
    Phenomena that include the force produced on a current-carrying wire in a
    magnetic field, the force between current-carrying wires, Faradayâ€™s Law of
    Electromagnetic Induction, the principles of transformers and the workings
    of motors and generators can all be understood as instances of forces
    acting on moving charged particles in magnetic fields.  The law of
    conservation of energy underpins all of these interactions. The conversion
    of energy into forms other than the intended form is a problem that
    constantly drives engineers to improve designs of electromagnetic devices.
