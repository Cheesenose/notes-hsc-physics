Electromagnetic Induction
=========================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How are electric and magnetic fields related?

   * describe how magnetic flux can change, with reference to the relationship $\Phi=B_{\parallel}A = BA\cos\theta$ (ACSPH083, ACSPH107, ACSPH109)  

   * analyse qualitatively and quantitatively, with reference to energy transfers and transformations, examples of Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law $\varepsilon=-N\frac{\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}$, including but not limited to: (ACSPH081, ACSPH110)  

     * the generation of an electromotive force (emf) and evidence for Lenz’s Law produced by the relative movement between a magnet, straight conductors, metal plates and solenoids

     * the generation of an emf produced by the relative movement or changes in current in one solenoid in the vicinity of another solenoid

   * analyse quantitatively the operation of ideal transformers through the application of: (ACSPH110)  

     * $\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}$

     * $V_pI_p = V_sI_s$

   * evaluate qualitatively the limitations of the ideal transformer model and the strategies used to improve transformer efficiency, including but not limited to: 

     * incomplete flux linkage

     * resistive heat production and eddy currents

   * analyse applications of step-up and step-down transformers, including but not limited to:

     * the distribution of energy using high-voltage transmission lines
