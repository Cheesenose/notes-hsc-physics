Light: Wave Model
=================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** What evidence supports the classical wave model of light and what predictions can be made using this model?

   * conduct investigations to analyse qualitatively the diffraction of light (ACSPH048, ACSPH076) 

   * conduct investigations to analyse quantitatively the interference of light using double slit apparatus and diffraction gratings $d\sin\theta = m\lambda$ (ACSPH116, ACSPH117, ACSPH140)  

   * analyse the experimental evidence that supported the models of light that were proposed by Newton and Huygens (ACSPH050, ACSPH118, ACSPH123) 

   * conduct investigations quantitatively using the relationship of Malusâ€™ Law $I=I_{max}cos^2\theta$ for plane polarisation of light, to evaluate the significance of polarisation in developing a model for light (ACSPH050, ACSPH076, ACSPH120)
