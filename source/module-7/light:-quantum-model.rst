Light: Quantum Model
====================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** What evidence supports the particle model of light and what are the implications of this evidence for the development of the quantum model of light?

   * analyse the experimental evidence gathered about black body radiation, including Wienâ€™s Law  related to Planck's contribution to a changed model of light (ACSPH137)   

     * $\lambda_{max} = \frac{b}{T}$

   * investigate the evidence from photoelectric effect investigations that demonstrated inconsistency with the wave model for light (ACSPH087, ACSPH123, ACSPH137)  

   * analyse the photoelectric effect $K_{max} = hf - \phi$ as it occurs in metallic elements by applying the law of conservation of energy and the photon model of light, (ACSPH119)
