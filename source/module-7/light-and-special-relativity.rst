Light and Special Relativity
============================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** How does the behaviour of light affect concepts of time, space and matter?

   * analyse and evaluate the evidence confirming or denying Einstein’s two postulates:

     * the speed of light in a vacuum is an absolute constant

     * all inertial frames of reference are equivalent (ACSPH131)

   * investigate the evidence, from Einstein’s thought experiments and subsequent experimental validation, for time dilation $t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ and length contraction $l = l_0\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, and analyse quantitatively situations in which these are observed, for example:

     * observations of cosmic-origin muons at the Earth’s surface  

     * atomic clocks (Hafele–Keating experiment)   

     * evidence from particle accelerators   

     * evidence from cosmological studies 

   * describe the consequences and applications of relativistic momentum with reference to:

     * $p_v = \frac{m_0v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

     * the limitation on the maximum velocity of a particle imposed by special relativity (ACSPH133) 

   * Use Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence relationship $E=mc^2$ to calculate the energy released by processes in which mass is converted to energy, for example: (ACSPH134)  

     * production of energy by the sun

     * particle–antiparticle interactions, eg positron–electron annihilation

     * combustion of conventional fuel
