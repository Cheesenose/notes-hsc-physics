The Nature of Light
===================

    Prior to the 20th century, physicists, including Newton and Maxwell,
    developed theories and models about mechanics, electricity and magnetism
    and the nature of matter. These theories and models had great explanatory
    power and produced useful predictions. However, the 20th century saw major
    developments in physics as existing theories and models were challenged by
    new observations that could not be explained. These observations led to the
    development of quantum theory and the theory of relativity. Technologies
    arising from these theories have shaped the modern world. For example, the
    independence of the speed of light on the frame of observation or the
    motion of the source and observer had significant consequences for the
    measurement, and concepts about the nature, of time and space. Throughout
    this module, students explore the evidence supporting these physical
    theories, along with the power of scientific theories to make useful
    predictions.
