Electromagnetic Spectrum
========================

.. admonition:: Syllabus Excerpt

   **Inquiry Question:** What is light?

   * investigate Maxwell’s contribution to the classical theory of electromagnetism, including:

     * unification of electricity and magnetism

     * prediction of electromagnetic waves

     * prediction of velocity (ACSPH113)  

   * describe the production and propagation of electromagnetic waves and relate these processes qualitatively to the predictions made by Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory (ACSPH112, ACSPH113)

   * conduct investigations of historical and contemporary methods used to determine the speed of light and its current relationship to the measurement of time and distance (ACSPH082)  

   * conduct an investigation to examine a variety of spectra produced by discharge tubes, reflected sunlight or incandescent filaments

   * investigate how spectroscopy can be used to provide information about: 

     * the identification of elements

   * investigate how the spectra of stars can provide information on:  

     * surface temperature

     * rotational and translational velocity

     * density

     * chemical composition
